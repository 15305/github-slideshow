Hi, I am Aaraddhya Pandey, a fourth year undergraduate mathematics major at the Indian Institute of Science. Recently, I have been trying to learn github for various projects I would be doing over the next few years. I like talking about mathematics at length and wish to travel to every corner of the world. I am into different kinds of food as well, although many would call me a Bengali, seeing my love for sweets and different kinds of fish. Indeed, I am a Bengali and Bangla is my mother-tongue, but I still think that 'Indian' is what suits me better. The way Rakesh Sharma said that day, "Saare jahan se accha, Hindustan hamara!" Yes, India is a nation of a billion people and with million cultures.

I think I should leave now. Will update this page later, when I am done watching another episode of mission 2050.

Use the right arrow to learn more about me!







Where I belong?
---

I was born in a place named Purulia in the State of West Bengal, India. As a child, I was fond of playing cricket and wanted to be either a cricketer or an astronaut. It was that story of the death of Kalpana Chawla which inspired me to become an Astronaut. I mean, why not? Isn't space is the only place where every kid wants to visit just like a zoo or a nearby museum! I was no different. For obvious reasons that every Indian of our generation should understand, I was a big fan of 'the Wall' Rahul Dravid and I still remember the day when my father brought me a 'Britania' cricket bat. How can I forget that? Those wickets that we bought together with my friends by putting together pieces of our 'tiffinbox'. What? Later in life I somehow lost my love towards Cricket and invested myself into playing cards (not a gambler though?). Those morning fights for a single card with Riki (Haha, a friend of mine) me to that site. It feels like present. I guess I did a lot of mistakes in my life, but I still feel I am one of the happiest person on Earth. Finally coming back to my life story,  many  things are yet to happen in my life and I hope that I will be able fulfill those (un)known wishes (of mine) in coming years. Btw, I should let you know that I am planning to go to Princeton university for graduate studies in probability theory. The Institute of Advanced studies  at Princeton is a place that I have never thought (actually haven't heard of) of going during my high school, but by the time I had finished my first year of college at IISc, I was just in love with this place, and with a girl. What? Lets leave her for now as she will (not) tresspass in anymore (into my story).


Where I am coming from?

From both the parental sides my origins lie somewhere in Uttar Pradesh, another state in India. That place is quite far away from the place where I grew up. I never spoke Hindi till I was 18 ( yet I watched CID for those who know what it is) and somwhat magically I could 'master' the language in about a year ( I should tell you that many of my batchmates at IISc were behind this ). I guess this is what India is about. There's always something common between people even if they are from  two opposite corners of the country, maybe having completely different cultures.
